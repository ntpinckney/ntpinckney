# ✨️ W e l c o m e 

I'm a recent MS graduate in Information Technology with a concentration in Software Application Development, leveraging a background in graphic design to create user-centered, accessible interfaces. I'm passionate about creating intuitive software that makes everyday life a little easier. Also a proud cat dad. 🐈

## 💡 Current Projects

At the moment, I'm just updating some of my student projects so they can look more professional and have better code:
- 💊 TrackMyPills (Android) – A lightweight, no-frills medication tracking app designed to help users manage their medications with ease. It stores dosage amounts, total quantity available, administration types (e.g., pills or mg), and provides reminders based on user-defined times and custom intervals (e.g., "every four hours"). Includes light and dark mode support. Built with Java, XML, and Figma.
**STATUS: Almost done with implementation. Just running a few more tests and smoothing out the UI.** 
- ⛅ WeatherApp (Spring Boot) – A web-based weather tracking application that fetches and displays five-day forecasts based on location input. Built with Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript with plans for UI and feature enhancements.
**STATUS: Currently queued for continued development.**

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- Here’s my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/ntpinckneydesigns)! I’m currently moving more into software development, using my graphic design background to build better, more intuitive interfaces. Still, I’m open to creative projects or collaborations that use either (or both) of these skills.
